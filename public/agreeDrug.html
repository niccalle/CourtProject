					Everyone else disagrees. The consensus is that throwing a minor into prison filled with adults is completely ridiculous. The experience could scar Simon for the rest of his life, and no minor should ever be deprived of their childhood years like that. <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/03/03/the-17-year-old-adults#.Ucnua9SBs">This directly goes against the courts in states like North Carolina and New York, where 16 and 18 year olds can be classified as adults. </a>
Another juror mentions that because Simon was caught selling Marijuana and Psilocybin mushrooms (shrooms) to other minors, he should be sent to a rehabilitation center where he learns about the dangers of drugs while he finishes up his high school degree. What do you think?
