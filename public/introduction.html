					The Nullam Morris Committee on the Judiciary has decided that each of its citizens should have to perform in mandatory jury duty every year.  As a part of your annual jury duty, you have to sit in on a court case and determine its outcome. There are two sides to each court case, the plaintiff and the defendant. Because of Nullam Morris beliefs of equity, both sides are appointed attorneys for free. Here, you must choose between one of two court cases to sit in on. A 17 year old male, Simon, has been caught and arrested for dealing drugs and skipping school.
